The "mcmc_red_test" contains several test scripts to check if the different functions runs properly. Can also be used as a crude example of data analysis.

Required modules
================
- emcee
- corner

Suggestions
===========
Download the module "tqdm", which gives you the ability to display some nice progress bar, and tweak the "ensemble.py" file from the "emcee" module in order to have a progress bar during an MCMC analysis !
